# PlatON Network Whitepaper 2.0 Summary

The PlatON Network with the launch of the Whitepaper 2.0 brings a decentralised, AI computation network that connects data, algorithms, and computing power through privacy-preserving computation protocols.
This opens up a whole new world of possibilities with the democratization of data and AI, like automated trading strategies, building online risk profiles of customers, providing secure biometric authentication etc.
You can learn more about the project here on their [official webite](https://www.platon.network), or read more about their technology on [Medium](https://medium.com/platon-network/platon-2-0-white-paper-decentralized-privacy-preserving-ai-network-part-1-77f69135e05).
